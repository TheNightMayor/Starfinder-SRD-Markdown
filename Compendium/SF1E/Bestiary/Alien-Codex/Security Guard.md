# Security Guard
A security guard is a night sentry at a factory or other private facility, a frontier sheriff's deputy, or a rookie uniformed police officer. It can be a tough job, but security work at least offers a steady income for those who don't want turn to crime to make ends meet. Security guards are usually trained in defensive fighting and nonlethal tactics, enabling them to apprehend criminals rather thank kill them outright.
Security guards are sometimes looked down upon by those of higher ranks within the same force, but they represent the backbone of the force. Without them, even the idea of safety and security would be laughable.
Adaptation: A security guard can be a bouncer at a posh nightclub, a strikebreaker, a criminal thug or enforcer, or even a rookie bounty hunter looking for her first mark.
