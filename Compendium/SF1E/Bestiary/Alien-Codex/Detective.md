Description
Detectives are often the most skilled and experienced members of a security force, and their focus is on the investigation of crimes rather than day-to-day law enforcement. They attempt to ferret out the truth wherever it may hide, using intuition, persuasion, and their own powers of perception.
Detectives often work alone or with a single partner. The bond between two detectives can grow strong, with the two often eventually thinking as one as they work long hours to crack their cases.
Adaptation: Detectives can be an independent private investigators, selling their investigative expertise to any clients who have the money. Criminal organizations that suspect wrongdoing within their own ranks might also employ their own internal operatives to verify the loyalty of their members and enact retribution on behalf of the cartel when traitors are discovered.
