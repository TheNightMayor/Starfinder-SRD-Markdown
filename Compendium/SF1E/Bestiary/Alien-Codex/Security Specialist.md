Security forces often employ specialists with a variety of skills and abilities that regular security guards just don't have. Security specialists add spellcasting to their arsenal, blending magic and technology to fight crime.
A security specialist might be called upon to investigate crimes with a mystical bent, hack into a criminal syndicate's computer network, or provide magical combat support to traditional security personnel in the field. These spellcasters can gain a reputation for being weird or off-putting because of the nature of the forces they deal with on a regular basis, but many organizations find them to be invaluable resources.

Adaptation: A security specialist can be a corporate hacker or one employed by a government, or a mercenary technomancer for hire. If a security specialist is more of a criminal than a law- enforcement professional, he could be a hacker or spellcaster working for an organized crime outfit like the Aspis Consortium or the Golden League.
