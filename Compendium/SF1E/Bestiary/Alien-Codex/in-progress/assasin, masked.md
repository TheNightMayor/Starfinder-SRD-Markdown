Special Abilities
Masked Aspect (Ex) Twice per day, when a masked assassin dons a mask or other full-face covering, they can instantaneously take on the appearance of any creature they’ve seen in person within the past 24 hours. A creature must succeed at a Perception check to realize this is a disguise (DC = 20 + 1.5 × the masked assassin’s CR). This effect lasts for 10 minutes or until the effect is ended.
Description
Masked assassins use masks to skillfully disguise their appearance. They can change their entire aspect in the blink of an eye, making it easy to approach their targets unnoticed and escape into the crowd after eliminating the target. Masked assassins rely primarily on their ability to work in plain sight, and are most likely to be encountered by guards and hired hands while hunting. They’re typically hired to assassinate lower-value targets. If discovered, they typically flee rather than fight and risk capture or death.
