# Sylph
**Source** _Starfinder #14: Soldiers of Brass pg. 59_
Slyphs are descendants of species and creatures from the Material Plane that have strong connections to the Plane of Air, such as djinn. They can also arise in areas that have strong influences from the Plane of Air. Though sylphs can pass for other kinds of humanoids, they tend to be slender, and all have complex blue markings swirling across their skin. Sylphs are naturally reserved and they avoid attention.

## Size and Type

Sylphs are Medium outsiders with the native subtype.  

## Air Affinity

Sylphs have a +2 racial bonus to Acrobatics checks and, if able to fly, maneuverability one step better than normal.  

## Darkvision

Sylphs have darkvision with a range of 60 feet.  

## Electricity Resistance

Sylphs have electricity resistance 5.  

## Spell-Like Ability

Once per day, a sylph can use [[Flight]] (1st level) on herself as a spell-like ability. At 6th level, she can cast the 2nd-level version of the spell, and at 12th level, she cast the 3rd-level version of the spell. Her caster level is equal to her level.

# Alternate Racial Traits
The following are alternate racial traits for planar scions.

## Atmosphere Artificer
Breath is life for a great many creatures, and the scions of air are its keepers. A sylph with this trait can expend their daily use of flight to instead cast life bubble with a caster level equal to their level.  
This alters a sylph’s spell-like ability.

## Phantasm 
Some sylphs possess not only airy, half-visible bodies, but power over air in its aspect as the medium of sound. Such sylphs have a +4 racial bonus to Stealth checks.  
This replaces a sylph’s spell-like ability.

## Warp Element
When a planar scion with this trait makes an attack or casts a spell that would deal acid, cold, electricity, fire, or sonic damage, they can instead choose to match half of that damage to the element of their heritage (fire for ifrits, acid for oreads, electricity for sylphs, or cold for undines).  
This replaces each planar scion’s elemental affinity.
