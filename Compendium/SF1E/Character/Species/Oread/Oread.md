# Oread
**Source** _Starfinder #17: Solar Strike pg. 60_
Oreads are humanoids whose bloodline is infused with power from the Plane of Earth, such as from a shaitan. Oreads usually have skin of a dark neutral tone, and some have features that appear to be made of stone, crystal, or packed earth. Oreads are generally calm to the point of stoicism.

## Size and Type
Oreads are Medium outsiders with the native subtype.  

## Acid Resistance
Oreads have acid resistance 5.  

## Darkvision
Oreads have darkvision with a range of 60 feet.  

## Earth Affinity
Whenever an oread deals acid damage (including with spells such as _energy ray_), the oread can change it to bludgeoning damage instead. This doesn’t change anything else about the effect dealing the damage.  

## Spell-Like Ability
An oread can use _energy ray_ as a spell-like ability at will but can deal only acid damage with the ray. The oread’s caster level is equal to their level.

# Alternate Racial Traits
The following are alternate racial traits for planar scions.

## Mountain Rapport
Some oreads feel especially at home in mountainous environments. Oreads with this trait gain a +2 racial bonus to Acrobatics checks to balance across narrow ledges, Athletics checks to climb stony inclines, and Fortitude saves to prevent being fatigued by thin atmosphere due to altitude (Core Rulebook 397).  
This replaces earth affinity.

## Static Discharge
Some oreads born of waterless sand planets can draw upon the friction of their desert worlds to channel their elemental opposite. An oread with this trait can cast jolting surge once per day with a caster level equal to their level. At 8th level, they can use this ability one additional time per day; at 16th level, they gain a third use per day.  
This replaces an oread’s spell-like ability.

## Warp Element
When a planar scion with this trait makes an attack or casts a spell that would deal acid, cold, electricity, fire, or sonic damage, they can instead choose to match half of that damage to the element of their heritage (fire for ifrits, acid for oreads, electricity for sylphs, or cold for undines).  
This replaces each planar scion’s elemental affinity
