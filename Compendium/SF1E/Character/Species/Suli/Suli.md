# Suli

**Source** _Starfinder #14: Soldiers of Brass pg. 58_
Also called suli-jann, sulis are often the descendants of plane-hopping jann and mortal beings, although some sulis have elemental origins that are more mysterious. Sulis are difficult to recognize by sight, since they resemble ordinary humanoids with, perhaps, an occasional flash of elemental light in their eyes. Most manifest their otherworldly heritage at adolescence. Strong of body and personality, sulis readily survive and assimilate, making them one of the most widespread planar scions.

## Size and Type
Sulis are Medium outsiders with the native subtype.  

## Darkvision
Sulis have low-light vision.  

## Elemental Assault
As a swift action, a suli can cause half the damage dealt by a weapon she wields to be acid, cold, electricity, or fire damage for 1 round. A suli can use this ability on her unarmed strikes, causing them to be neither archaic nor nonlethal while the damage alteration persists. She can use this ability a number of times per day equal to her level or CR.  

## Elemental Resistance
Their elemental nature grants sulis resistance 5 to acid, cold, electricity, and fire.

# Alternate Racial Traits
The following are alternate racial traits for planar scions.

## Mental Fortitude
Some sulis inherit the ability to shield their minds from magic. The suli gains a +2 racial bonus to saving throws against mind-affecting effects and reduces damage taken from such effects by 5.  
This replaces elemental resistance.

## Skilled Mediator
Sulis raised by widely traveled jann parents or similar plane-hopping ancestors learn to traverse myriad societies with ease. A suli with this trait gains a +2 racial bonus to Culture and Diplomacy checks. They also gain an additional starting language from Aquan, Auran, Ignan, and Terran.  
This replaces elemental assault.
