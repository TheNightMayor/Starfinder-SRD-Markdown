# Megalonyxa

**Source** _Starfinder #27: Deceivers’ Moon pg. 57_
The stocky megalonyxa hail from the heavy gravity world of Karnoq in the Vast. There, they contemplated the stars as a mostly sedentary species, and were able to build a thriving civilization through the use of magic. Spaceflight eluded them, however. As such, when extraplanetary visitors arrived, they found a highly evolved society eager to take to the stars. Within a few decades, all megalonyxas left Karnoq, consigning their cities and other settlements to the wastes of history. Explorers from other worlds can learn much from these remains if they can withstand the planet’s crushing gravity.  
A typical megalonyxa stands about 10 feet tall and weighs 500 pounds.
