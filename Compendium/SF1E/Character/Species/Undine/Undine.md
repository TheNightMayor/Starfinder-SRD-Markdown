# Undine

**Source** _Starfinder #18: Assault on the Crucible pg. 58_
Undines are the descendants of humanoids and beings who hail from the Plane of Water. Through they don’t require water to live, undines tend to settle near water and make ideal underwater explorers.

## Size and Type

Undines are Medium outsiders with the native subtype.  

## Cold Resistance

Undines have cold resistance 5.  

## Darkvision

Undines have darkvision with a range of 60 feet.  

## Spell-Like Ability

An undine can cast _energy ray_ as a spell-like ability at will but can deal only cold damage with the ray. Their caster level is equal to their level.  

## Undine Movement

Undines have both a land speed and a swim speed of 30 feet.  

## Water Affinity

Whenever an undine deals cold damage while either the undine or her target is swimming, or in precipitation or storms heavy enough to reduce visibility ranges, they deal an amount of additional damage equal to twice their level.

# Alternate Racial Traits
The following are alternate racial traits for planar scions.

##  Incompressible

Water’s nearly incompressible nature makes the liquid a useful component in starship cushioning and safety systems, and certain undines are similarly incompressible. An undine with this trait gains DR 5/piercing or slashing.  
This replaces an undine’s spell-like ability.

## Warp Element
When a planar scion with this trait makes an attack or casts a spell that would deal acid, cold, electricity, fire, or sonic damage, they can instead choose to match half of that damage to the element of their heritage (fire for ifrits, acid for oreads, electricity for sylphs, or cold for undines).  
This replaces each planar scion’s elemental affinity
